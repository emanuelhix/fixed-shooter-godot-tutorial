## Overview ##

This workshop is designed to help you build a game reminiscent of Galaga. It caters to both beginners in game development and those looking to familiarize themselves with **Godot 4.x**.

## Repository Objective ##

The purpose of this repository is to offer a well-organized and functional version of the project post-workshop. It addresses a few deviations from the workshop, specifically resolving some memory leaks and enhancing the organization of scenes for improved clarity.
